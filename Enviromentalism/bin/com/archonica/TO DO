									 REWRITING CAST CODE

New system: Casts come in an indexed library.

Thus, specific variant casts will have certain initialized variables.  These should be final.

WARNING: New system does not support Sustained casts.  Need to fix this.











We need to:

Create library of effects
Create library of elementals
Create library of casts

Create special effects:
	wisps


Create logic for modifiers

Create logic for controlbars and casting

Create logic for flying objects


!Create interface


!!Connect game logic to engine
!!Connect game logic to networking
